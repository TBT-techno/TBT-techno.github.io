<h4>You can trust in us</h4>

<p>Tru-Breed Technologies was created by three academics working in plant
ecology and evolutionary-genomics research. Our careers are focused
on developing cutting-edge methods for understanding and classifying plant
diversity and relationships. The bioinformatic software that we use, and
which is used broadly throughout our field, was developed by one of our
founders. Our expertise in data generation and analysis means that you can
rely on us to provide academic quality results.</p>

<p>We have *zero ties to pharmaceutical companies* and will never try to share or
sell your private information. Our business is 100% employee owned, with no
relationships to biomedical or pharmaceutical companies or investors.</p>
