The genetic diversity and ancestry composition of plant varieties can
be used to direct smarter and more reliable plant breeding strategies.
Find out whether your variety is stable and true-breeding based on
variation at millions of genomic sites, and identify cultivars with
unique genetic variation for creating new crosses.

Our tests can help you to learn the relationship of your strain to
other common varieties on the market, which in turn can help you to
design crosses between distinct varieties that either maximizes or
minimizes genetic variation while targeting your traits of interest.
