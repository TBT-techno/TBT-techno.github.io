#### Our genomic test yields >10X more data than our competitors

!!!! Although the cost of DNA sequencing has dropped precipitously over the last
decade, genome sequencing remains prohibitively expensive for many research
programs, such as plant breeding, where routine re-sequencing of individuals
is necessary. Yet such genomic information is highly valuable, for its ability
to provide diversity statistics to improve breeding strategies, and as
a simple method for verifying strain identities, protecting intellectual
property rights, and ensuring quality control throughout complex supply chains.

Only very recently, with the emergence a new exciting techonology called
*fractional DNA sequencing*, has the cost of genotyping been reduced to the
point that routine genomic verification is economically feasible.
In contrast to the technology used by our competitors, our fractional DNA
sequencing approach targets >10X as many genomic regions, allowing for much
finer-scale resolution of relationships, and identification of ancestry
proportions. Having used fractional DNA sequencing in our academic research,
it became clear that we could provide a much better service to the
*Cannabis* industry -- in terms of both data quality and price -- than what
is otherwise available on the market.

**Our complete end-to-end genomics service** involves fractional DNA
sequencing, bioinformatic analysis of results, and consulting. Contact
us today to discuss how you can benefit from our genomics service. At the
cost of **$199 per sample**, the value and quality of our service
cannot be beat.
