Only a few years ago it took weeks to sequence only a few thousand base pairs,
providing a genetic “fingerprint” that was entirely insufficient to hold up in
court as evidence for the uniqueness of a plant variety. We can now sequence
and analyze trillions of base pairs, across hundreds of individuals in a matter
of days, with the consequence that even highly similar plant strains can be
uniquely distinguished. Our proprietary bioinformatics pipeline is the most
advanced technology presently available in the industry, and is optimized
for the analysis of complex hybrid admixtures.
