Every strain is the result of years of intense and laborious breeding.
Don't let someone else use your name to market an illegitimate strain. Certify
your strains to protect your intellectual property and be prepared to meet future regulations. We offer diagnostic statistics to verify the uniqueness of
individual strains within the context of a vast database of known diversity.

Your customers want to know what they are buying. Our genomic certification
tells them that you care about the true identity of your product.
Increase sales by giving your customers confidence in the quality of your
product.
