Our **detailed ancestry report** is easily interpretable for experts and non-experts
alike. Each report contains a massive amount of genetic information summarized into
simple statistics that can be applied to better understand your strain. Our test
uses cutting-edge genomic technologies to target *>10X as many sites* as our
competitors.


We've established a curated database that includes many of the most popular
strains on the market with which to compare your strains. Learn the genetic
placement of your strain, it's taxonomic distinctiveness, and use this
information to defend legal challenges to your naming and patenting rights.

Our service also provides what is currently the only available test to report
**hybrid admixture proportions**, representing the percentage of ancestry from
which a contemporary strain is derived from three historically distinct
*Cannabis* taxa. Market your brand with information about its ancestry and
composition to provide a more curated experience for your customers.

In addition to providing individual ancestry reports for each strain that we
sequence, we also provide **cohort reports** for each customer, with population
analyses comparing all of your samples to each other, as well as to our global
database. These reports can be especially valuable to plant breeders, to understand
the diversity of strains that you wish to stabilize, and to follow the trajectory
of new hybrid strains through successive generations of crossing.

**Contact us today** with details of your order -- how many samples (individuals) you
wish to sequence, and where you will be sending samples from. We will send you a simple sample preparation kit with instructions for preserving leaf/stem tissues and
return shipping instructions.
