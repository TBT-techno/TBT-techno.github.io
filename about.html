									<h3 class="major">Our technology is superior</h3>
									<p>Only a few years ago it took weeks to sequence only a few thousand base pairs, providing a genetic “fingerprint” that was entirely unsufficient to hold up in court as evidence for the uniqueness of a plant variety. We can now sequence and analyze trillions of base pairs, across hundreds of individuals in a matter of days, with the consequence that even highly similar plant strains can be uniquely distinguished. Our proprietary bioinformatics pipeline is the most advanced technology presently available in the industry, and is optimized for the analysis of complex hybrid admixtures.

									<h3 class="major">We offer more for less money</h3>
									<p>In addition to species admixture percentage and several stability statistics, we offer selection statistics, breeding potential, and tests for auto-flowering genes and feminization.</p>

									<h3 class="major">We have no connections to pharmaceutical companies</h3>
									<p>And we guarantee never to sell or pass on your sequences. Beware of companies with connections to pharmaceutical companies or biomedical backgrounds. We believe that your intellectual property should remain your intellectual property. Do not give away your sequences without making sure they’re protected!</p>

									<h3 class="major">We are academics with research careers in plant hybridization</h3>
									<p>We are botanists, ecologists, and geneticists with dozens of peer-reviewed scientific papers. Our company is 100% employee-owned and not beholden to venture capitalists or large biotech companies.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Our certification will add instant value to your crop</h3>
									<p>We aim to provide a service to plant breeders that will help not only to improve their crop, but also to protect it as intellectual property. This is the time to stake your claim.</p>
